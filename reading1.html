<h1> Media Reflection </h1>

<p> The way I think of photography and image-making is as a simple but powerful way to understand both yourself and the world around you. Starting college for me is a big transition. Everything feels new at once: new routines, new people, new expectations. It’s  not always easy to put those feelings into words. With all of these factors photography gives me another way to express what I'm experiencing. Taking pictures of my daily life, walking to my classes, the subway ride home, or a quiet moment on campus, can help me slow down and notice things I might otherwise ignore. Although these images may seem insignificant, they act as a visual diary for me to look back at and just think about how the days go by. On a personal level, photography helps me explore my identity. I use selfies to show how I see myself right now, and I take photos of myself in the gym in order to track my progress and motivate myself. Even the small choices I make, such as what I photograph, what I crop out, or what I focus on say something about what matters to me. Photography doesn’t have to be perfect or polished to be meaningful. Sometimes blurry, dark, or imperfect images can better convey a certain moment and what emotions I was feeling when taking that photo. Being at Hunter College also means being in New York City, a place full of stories happening all at once. Photography helps me respond to the world at this moment in a very direct way. Sometimes I photograph crowded spaces, advertisements, protests, or moments of isolation in public places to show what life feels like right now. Even though I may not know it while taking the photos, those images can reflect bigger issues like inequality, technology, or how people connect, or don’t connect with each other. By focusing on real places and real people, photography helps make these big ideas feel more human and relatable. 
    Combining images with text or illustration can allow me to make my work even more personal. Writing a few sentences or adding handwritten notes can explain what the image means to me or describe a feeling that isn’t visible in the photo. Illustration is a tool that can be used to add emotions, symbols, or thoughts that exist in my mind but not in the physical world. For example, you could draw over a photograph to show anxiety, hope, or pressure. Mixing image and text reflects how we experience life today, through photos, captions, messages, and screens. Overall, photography and image-making allows me to pay attention, reflect, and express myself honestly. Whether I’m just taking a photo of myself walking in the city, a picture of me while I’m out with my friends, or a photo of me hiking in the forest, each photo has a personal significance to me and is a way to look back and remember a beautiful moment.
