    <p>  Hi, My name is Evan, I am 18 years old and my biggest interests are nature and being in the outdoors. Ever since I was a little kid I always had
        a fascination for all types of animlas and especially those that inhabited the ocean. At first I wanted to be a marine biologist, but then I gained
        an interest for Acupuncture because of my moms business. My interest for eastern philosophy and Eastern Medicinegrew the more I learned about it.
        <br> 
         With this in mind I want to use the skills I will learn in this class to help my mom in the media/marketing sector of her business. Learning how to 
        create website from scratch is definetley a useful skill nowadays for anybody who has their own business, or is trying to advertise something. I dont 
        know much about website making, or other things such as photo shop and adobe illustrator, but I am very excited to learn these skills, so that I can use
        them to my advantage in the future. I am excited to see what types of assignments and projects we will be learning in this class, since this is all 
        pretty much new to me!
